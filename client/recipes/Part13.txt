Part #13 - Template Level Subscriptions
---------------------------------------

	Set up a subscription to subscribe to only the recipes we need when looking at the
	recipes book page.

	- Subscribe to the recipes at the template level, rather than the 'client' level
	- Comment out the subscription
	- Subscriptions are an important part of performance, you only want to subscribe
		and publish the things you will need.
	- Subscription management is part of having a performative operation.
	- We will keep the subscribe at the template level.

	Template.Recipes.onCreated(function() {
		var self = this;
		self.autorun(function() {
			self.subscribe('recipes');
		});
	});

	* Autorun will unsubscribe us from any old subscriptions.

	- This will disconnect the subscription from being dependant on any route.  This
	will allow us to place the recipes template anywhere else on the page.

	- We can now say
		Recipes.html

			{{#if Template.subscriptionsReady}}
				(each recipes)
				{{else}}
					<p>Loading</p>
			{{/if}}
